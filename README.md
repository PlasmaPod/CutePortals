CutePortals is a portal plugin that can do some usefull stuff for your Spigot and BungeeCord servers. With it help you can create portals consisting of nether portal blocks that can perform various actions:
- Transport players between servers under your BungeeCord network using portals;
- Execute commands from console or player when a player arrives at destination server after transportation;
- Execute commands from console or player when a player just enters a portal;
- Create commands that can duplicate actions above, but without using portals (this feature can be used in ChestCommands-like menu plugins, visit <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cuteportals.28520/">project page on SpigotMC</a> for more info, guides and examples).
